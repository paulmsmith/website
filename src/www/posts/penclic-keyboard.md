Have I finally found the perfect keyboard?

At the time of writing. I have owned the [Penclic KB3 Mini Wireless Keyboard](https://penclic.se/product/mini-wireless-keyboard-kb3-black/) for a mere 2 hours but already I think this might just be the keyboard I have been searching for most of my working life.
