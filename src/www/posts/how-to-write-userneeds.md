## What are user needs?

The one line definition of 'user needs' I tend to give is:

> **‘User needs’
> are the needs that a user has of a service, and which that service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for them.**

People smarter than me have written about user needs in detail, so rather than duplicate their efforts, next is a step-by-step guide linking to their excellent content.

## Step-by-step guide to understanding user needs

I encourage you to read them all and in order to help you fully understand this fundamental concept of user centred design.

<ol class="list list--step-by-step">
  <li>
    <p>First read <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs#understanding-user-needs">Learning about users and their needs</a> &ndash; from the UK government service manual. It gives a brief introduction to what user needs are and why you should seek to satisfy user needs in the design of your service or product.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next see Ben Holliday's approach to <a href="https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2017/07/14/leading-service-design-user-needs/">understanding different types of user needs</a> &ndash; this should give you a more rounded view of what they are.</p>
    <p>This is important because as Ben says, user research should be used to understand real life stages and context, not only the needs that IT projects or existing products create.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Armed with an understanding of the different types of user need, read Pete Gale's post: <a href="https://www.hollidazed.co.uk/2017/07/14/leading-service-design-user-needs/">How we talk about user needs</a>.</p>
    <p>Acknowledging the origin of a particular need can help you to keep in mind what your users are really trying to do and what is the result of service design itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Hopefully by this point what user needs are, should be reasonably clear to you as well as why service design tends to start with user needs.
    </p>
    <p>Now I encourage you to read Will Myddelton's Useful Heresy number 1 <a href="https://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/research-heresies#yui_3_17_2_1_1623878795313_169">'User needs' is a harmful concept for training researchers</a> which is an excellent examination of the user needs concept, why its difficult to grasp and why it is more than a set of neatly organised user stories.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
