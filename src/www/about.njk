  ## How I like to work

  {% endmarkdown %}

  <h3 class="u-!-margin-bottom-0">With user research</h3>
  <p class="u-!-margin-top-0">Understanding people, their needs and context is critical to my work as a designer. We can have more confidence in our work when it is informed by user research, especially reseach we have taken part in.</p>

  <h3 class="u-!-margin-bottom-0">In the open</h3>
  <p class="u-!-margin-top-0">The sooner you share, the sooner mistakes are spotted, ideas are refined and people are included.</p>

  <h3 class="u-!-margin-bottom-0">Collaboratively</h3>
  <p class="u-!-margin-top-0">Better ideas and solutions to problems are found by working with (not only for) users and colleagues.</p>

  <h3 class="u-!-margin-bottom-0">Inclusively</h3>
  <p class="u-!-margin-top-0">It should be important to all designers that their work does not exclude people with different physical, mental health, social, cultural or learning needs.</p>
