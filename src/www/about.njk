  ## Ways of working

  User research is critical to my work as a designer. We can have much higher confidence in our work when it is informed by user research, especial reseach we have taken part in.

  Sharing and working in the open. The sooner you share, the sooner mistakes are spotted, ideas are refined and people are included.
