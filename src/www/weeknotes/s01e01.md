- I start a new role at the [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) next week, so I have been preparing, getting access to emails and that sort of thing. Thank you to [Paul](https://twitter.com/psd), [Matt](https://twitter.com/mattlucht) and [Ben](https://twitter.com/BforBen) for assisting.
- The weather was predicted to be good this week, so Gillian (my better half), our dog Ted and I made a commitment to make the most of it walking in our local area, finding new routes around [Heaton Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaton_Park).
- I indulged my Nike addiction and bought a pair of [JRDN MA2 sneakers](https://www.nike.com/gb/t/jordan-ma2-greatest-gift-shoe-JCCWnC/CV8122-002) {% imgr { imagePath: 'content/ma2.jpg' } %}
