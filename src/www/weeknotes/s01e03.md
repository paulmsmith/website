In a [sombre week for the UK](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56779068), I:

- Had a chat with [Si](https://ermlikeyeah.com) about design, delivery and some useful things worth knowing about my new organisation and to my new role. Really grateful for the advice and warm welcome.
- Turned down an opportunity that in other circumstances I would have loved to do. Sorry for being cryptic with this one but I wanted to acknowledge it and say I will never take my good fortune for granted and keep working hard to pay it forward as much as I can.
- Installed [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [tmuxp](https://tmuxp.git-pull.com/) which has enabled me to get code projects up and running again quickly with less typing.
- Read '[Embrace the grind](https://jacobian.org/2021/apr/7/embrace-the-grind/) by Jacob Kaplan-Moss and really loved the message. Sometimes it does just take a shedload of hardwork to pull off what others say isn't possible.
- Listened in a few times on some of the team discussing really hard data problems and how they might approach them.
- Learnt more from my new colleagues. This week I learned about '[Compact URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE)' (also known as a CURIE)
- I helped a friend with writing their supporting statement to apply for a new role.
- Updated some of the code on this site to make debugging and building easier.
- Tried my first ever '[Cinnabon](https://www.cinnabon.uk/)'. It was so very good indeed.
