I took a break last week from Weeknotes, primarily because I had forgotten to keep a log of each day and so found myself struggling to remember things worth sharing.

I've decided that it's OK to miss a week now and then.

## Jabbed <span aria-hidden="true">üíâ</span>

- Had my 1st Covid vaccination! As I'm under 40 the UK NHS offered me the [Pfizer BionTech](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-uk-recipients-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine) flavour of corona kicking goodness.

- Started saying hello to users and stakeholders of the service I work on.&mdash;This past sprint we met remotely with [LandStack](https://landstack.co.uk/) who are doing interesting work to collect data and build tools to help people find planning applications, allocations and land availability assessments.
  &mdash;It was good to hear their story and to talk about their concerns about planning data as well as get feedback about the work of the Digital Land team.

- Worked with [Colm](https://www.colmjude.com/about) to update the design of [data records](https://digital-land.github.io/brownfield-land/local-authority-eng/ADU/ADCBR5/#record) page on the [digital land site](https://digital-land.github.io/) - Adding a new section (tab) to provide details of whether or not it has been referenced by other records.
- Helped [Katie](https://twitter.com/KTglaubius) (User Researcher I work with) to design and plan some workshops we'd like conduct with groups of users and stakeholders.
- Tried '[Nova](https://nova.app/)' a native mac code editor from [Panic Software](https://panic.com).
  I currently use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but every now and then it feels slow and overcomplicated for what I need.

- I went back to the gym since my last weeknote. I want to lose weight and feel better about myself because for quite a while I have essentially abused my body and used food as a way of burying my emotions.

  All of us have suffered during this pandemic and I had an incredibly stressful 2020. I noticed just how much physical exercise helps my mental health.

  The pandemic has impacted my fitness and progress because it forced [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) and Gyms to close, both of which helped me stay motivated and active.

### Linknotes

- [Invisible interface](zeno.zone/#thesis) A thesis by Zeno Kapitein examining flow in digital tools.
- [What is a product?](https://sambuddington.medium.com/what-is-a-product-210ae8f93843) - Most product managers implicitly know what a product is when they see it. But it is very hard to define. Sam Buddington gives his take.
- [A better roadmap](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/a-better-roadmap-mind-map-mousetrap-cdbacaaa664b) - A framework for teams and product managers to understand the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù.
- Use an [AeroPress](https://www.aeropress.co.uk/) to make your morning coffee? I asked twitter for coffee recommendations and tips.&mdash;One link I was sent was to [James Hoffman's Ultimate AeroPress technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc&list=PLxz0FjZMVOl2858ytsWi9DH8NUKAz4nvl&index=3) - well worth watching if like me you've always been a little bit 'Am I doing this right?' with an AeroPress.

  Prefer to read your brewing instructions? [Scott Colfer](https://twitter.com/scottcolfer) sent me a link to a [blog post detailing his AeroPress method](https://scottcolfer.com/coffee/2018/03/03/aeropress.html).
